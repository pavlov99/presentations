# Presentations given by @pavlov99

I like technical slides to be pretty and often use LaTeX for them. Perhaps, I'm not that good at PowerPoint. I also like to give examples/demos as they clarify the process and explain better than words. Most of the presentations have full examples in this repository and back-up code snippets in slides.
